            <h1>Helping landlords communicate they're ready to move forward with an applicant</h1>
            <p>
                Landlords want to communicate to prospective renters that their application has been selected
                and that they want to move forward in the process of securing them as tenants.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, landlords solve this problem by calling, texting, or emailing selected applicants to relay
                the news and discuss the next steps. To streamline this step and make it more efficient, Zillow
                Rental applications created the functionality to communicate this digitally through our
                applications platform with the "Accept" functionality. Unfortunately, we weren't seeing this
                feature's adoption that we would like to see and wanted to find out why.
