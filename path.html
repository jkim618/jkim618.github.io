            <h2>Design Decision 1: Reorganizing Dashboard Sections for Improved Usability</h2>
            <p>Initially, the dashboard featured a long, scrollable page that combined "Loss Impact" and "Solution Matrix" into a single section. To enhance the user experience and reduce cognitive overload, I redesigned the layout to implement a navigation system that separated these two sections. This update allows users to effortlessly switch between sections using distinct call-to-action buttons, promoting a more intuitive and streamlined experience. By dividing the "Loss Impact" and "Solution Matrix" sections into two separate pages, we reduced the amount of content that needed to be loaded at once, which improved the platform's performance and enhanced content organization.

            </div>
            <h2>Design Decision 2: Use of Filter Chips</h2>
            <p>To provide users with more control over the displayed data, we implemented filter chips. These filter chips allow users to refine the displayed graph and table by selecting specific loss drivers. This granular filtering capability enables users to focus on relevant information</p>
