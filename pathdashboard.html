                <div class="two-column">
                    <div class="text-section">
                        <p>After receiving the initial concept design from stakeholders, our UX team identified critical issues:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <p>1. <span class="highlight">Unclear checkbox functionality</span> hindered selection clarity.</p>
                            <p>2. <span class="highlight">Duplicate dropdowns</span> caused confusion by changing each other unintentionally.</p>
                            <p>3. An <span class="highlight">overloaded two-column design</span> lacked hierarchy, complicating key information retrieval.</p>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These issues resulted in <span class="highlight">inadequate navigation, unclear information hierarchy, and a disjointed user flow</span>, significantly challenging users in comprehending and effectively navigating the platform.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-section">

                </div>
                
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>To address the identified challenges, several enhancements were implemented:</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. <span class="highlight">Global header and tabbed layouts</span> to ensure consistent navigation and establish a clear information hierarchy.</p>
                    <p>2. Prominent <span class="highlight">call-to-action button</span> to clearly indicate navigation to a different section.</p>
                    <p>3. <span class="highlight">Filter chips</span> to facilitate efficient information filtering, enabling users to quickly refine and focus on relevant content.</p>
                </ul>

                    <img src="path/images/pathafter_new.png">
                </div>

                <h2>Research and Insight</h2>
                <p>Our team conducted stakeholder meetings to gather crucial insights, shaping the redesign process to align with business objectives and user needs effectively. </p>
                <div class="research-box-container">
                    <div class="research-box">

                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Design Goals</h2>
                <p>Based on the user needs and stakeholder requirements, I summarized the higher level goals I hope to achieve with the redesign.</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. <strong>Enhance navigation: </strong> Improve the platform's navigation to allow users to move between sections seamlessly and access features efficiently.</p>
                    <p>2. <strong>Clarify Information Hierarchy: </strong> Establish a clear and logical arrangement of
                        content to help users easily find and understand relevant information.</p>
                    <p>3. <strong>Create a Cohesive User Flow: </strong> Develop a consistent and intuitive flow
                        throughout the dashboard to guide users through their tasks and interactions smoothly.</p>
                    <p>4. <strong>Facilitate Data Exploration: </strong> Enable users to explore and analyze data
                        effectively by providing robust filtering options, allowing them to refine their view and
                        focus on specific information relevant to their needs.</p>

                </ul>

                <h2>Initial Wireframes</h2>
                <div class="two-column">
                    <div class="text-section">
                        <p>Following a session with stakeholders, I quickly created a preliminary wireframe to initiate discussions. Although it was a rough draft, it effectively communicated my ideas and highlighted the potential advantages and drawbacks.</p>
                        <p>Pros:</p>
                        <ul class="pros">
                            <p>1. Improved information hierarchy with a top-down approach.</p>
                            <p>2. Ability to filter information based on loss drivers.</p>
                            <p>3. Combined view of the solution matrix graph and table, providing comprehensive data in one glance.</p>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Cons:</p>
                        <ul class="cons">
                            <p>1. Potential confusion from using two dropdowns for vertical and subvertical.</p>
                            <p>2. The solution matrix graph appears small and cramped.</p>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Key takeaways were to make the vertical and subvertical elements more prominent, enlarge the solution matrix graph, and defer vendor information display.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-section">
                        <img src="path/images/uglywireframe.png" alt="Problem Image">
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Solution Matrix Iteration</h2>
                <p>After receiving feedback from stakeholders, I created improved wireframes. I enlarged the solution matrix and replaced the vendor preview with a 'Compare Top Vendors' text link, using the freed space for solution information preview. However, both iterations had issues with the lengthy loss drivers column, even when using an expand-collapse format. To address this, I iterated again, turning the loss drivers into <span class="highlight">colored keys</span>.</p>

                <div class="imgContainer">
                    <img src="path/images/iterations.png">
                </div>
                <h2>Design Decision 1: Dropdowns and Navigation Tabs for Data Selection</h2>
                <p>To address the limitations of relying solely on dropdowns for data selection, we implemented a dual
                    approach. This includes a top-level filter using dropdowns and the introduction of navigation tabs.
                    This enhancement provides users with more intuitive ways to filter and navigate through different
                    datasets, improving overall usability and user experience. </p>

                </div>
                <h2>Design Decision 2: Reorganizing Dashboard Sections for Improved Usability</h2>
                <p>I separated the
                    "Loss Impact" and "Solution Matrix" sections into distinct pages in my later iteration, enhancing
                    user experience by
                    reducing cognitive overload. Users can now effortlessly switch between sections using dedicated
                    buttons, promoting a more intuitive and streamlined experience. This reorganization not only
                    improved platform performance by reducing the amount of content loaded at once but also enhanced
                    content organization.

                </div>
                <h2>Design Decision 3: Use of Filter Chips</h2>
                <p>To provide users with more control over the displayed data, we implemented filter chips. These filter
                    chips allow users to refine the displayed graph and table by selecting specific loss drivers.</p>

                                Specifically, user testing could have helped validate the redesign decisions, such as
                                the introduction of a clear information hierarchy and intuitive navigation.</p>
