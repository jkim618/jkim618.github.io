                <p>In the dynamic landscape of risk management and health and wellness, the USI PATH platform emerged as a game-changer, promising to Prevent, Abate, Uncover treasures, and improve Health for both employees and organizations.</p>
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>After receiving the initial concept design from stakeholders, our UX team identified critical issues. The design lacked intuitive navigation, a clear information hierarchy, and a cohesive user flow, posing challenges for users in comprehending and navigating the platform effectively.</p>

                <p>The redesigned dashboard introduces a <strong>clear information hierarchy, intuitive navigation, and a cohesive user flow </strong>, enhancing the platform's usability. These improvements aim to provide a more
                    streamlined and user-friendly experience for PATH platform users.</p>

                    information organization and efficiency. By optimizing text density in the table and its preview, the design makes effective use of <strong>UI real estate</strong>, ensuring a clean and concise presentation of data.

                <h2>Design Decision 1: Dropdowns and Navigation Tabs for Data Selection</h2>
                <p>To address the limitations of relying solely on dropdowns for data selection, we implemented a dual
                    approach. This includes a top-level filter using dropdowns and the introduction of navigation tabs.
                    This enhancement provides users with more intuitive ways to filter and navigate through different
                    datasets, improving overall usability and user experience. </p>

                <p>I separated the
                    "Loss Impact" and "Solution Matrix" sections into distinct pages in my later iteration, enhancing
                    user experience by
                    reducing cognitive overload. Users can now effortlessly switch between sections using dedicated
                    buttons, promoting a more intuitive and streamlined experience. This reorganization not only
                    improved platform performance by reducing the amount of content loaded at once but also enhanced
                    content organization.

                <h2>Design Decision 3: Use of Filter Chips</h2>
                <p>To provide users with more control over the displayed data, we implemented filter chips. These filter
                    chips allow users to refine the displayed graph and table by selecting specific loss drivers.</p>
