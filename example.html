    <h2>Coach‚Äôs Pick: A UX Case Study</h2>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Design an override workflow that gives underwriters and business users the ability to promote or exclude insurance carriers from algorithmic recommendations based on nuanced, strategic business needs.</p>
    <p>In UPlace, carrier recommendations were driven by backend algorithms that ranked insurers based on factors like pricing, coverage match, and historical performance. However, underwriters often needed to manually intervene ‚Äî especially when business priorities or regional realities contradicted what the system suggested. Coach‚Äôs Pick was created to bridge that gap ‚Äî enabling human override in a structured, transparent, and scalable way.</p>

    <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>
    <p>I began the project by conducting <strong>semi-structured interviews</strong> with 7 users, including senior underwriters, business analysts, and regional managers. These conversations uncovered both workflow pain points and deeper systemic trust issues.</p>
  
    <h3>Research Questions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In what scenarios do you override the system‚Äôs recommended carriers?</li>
      <li>What signals or attributes influence your decision to promote or exclude a carrier?</li>
      <li>How important is geographic or industry-based targeting?</li>
      <li>What are your current workarounds?</li>
      <li>What would make an override tool feel fast, reliable, and trustworthy?</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manual Overrides Are Frequent:</strong> Users often ignored algorithmic rankings, preferring their own judgment based on regional insight, recent claims behavior, or business relationships.</li>
      <li><strong>No Native Controls:</strong> Overrides required manual engineering tickets or offline documentation, creating delays and inconsistency.</li>
      <li><strong>Overrides Needed Precision:</strong> Adjustments needed to apply at the <strong>state</strong> and <strong>NAICS code</strong> level, not broad categories.</li>
      <li><strong>Speed Was Crucial:</strong> Underwriters wanted to make bulk changes quickly, then refine selections as needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency Was Non-Negotiable:</strong> Manual changes had to be traceable to avoid internal friction and maintain confidence in recommendations.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  
  <section class="section">
    <h2>How Research Informed the Design</h2>
    <p>Every major component in the override workflow was a direct response to user insight:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Carrier override toggles</strong> addressed the need for manual control when system recommendations failed.</li>
      <li><strong>NAICS and state selectors</strong> supported highly specific targeting ‚Äî a common user expectation uncovered in discovery.</li>
      <li><strong>Bulk select with fine-tuning</strong> emerged after early feedback revealed the inefficiency of dropdowns and region-based tabs.</li>
      <li><strong>Review step</strong> improved confidence and reduced fear of accidental changes, especially among newer users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Personas</h2>
    <p><strong>Angela ‚Äì Senior Underwriter</strong><br>
    ‚Ä¢ 15+ years of experience<br>
    ‚Ä¢ Needs precise control across different industries and states<br>
    ‚Ä¢ Values autonomy and resents opaque systems</p>
  
    <p><strong>James ‚Äì Regional Business Analyst</strong><br>
    ‚Ä¢ Balances carrier strategy with underwriting performance<br>
    ‚Ä¢ Supports multiple underwriters with reporting and insight<br>
    ‚Ä¢ Needs scalable controls with low friction</p>

    <h2>Designing the Override Workflow</h2>
    <p>Based on the research, I proposed a linear step-by-step workflow that focused on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> One decision at a time ‚Äî first choose a carrier, then apply override type</li>
      <li><strong>Targeting:</strong> Apply changes by NAICS code and/or state with bulk select and deselect</li>
      <li><strong>Review:</strong> Final screen to validate logic before saving override</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This structure aligned with how users thought: start broad, then refine. It also reduced the cognitive load by avoiding complex controls like sliders or dynamic weighting.</p>

    <h2>Design Iterations</h2>
  
    <h3>State Targeting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>V1 ‚Äì Multi-select Dropdown:</strong> Too tedious for bulk selections</li>
      <li><strong>V2 ‚Äì Regional Tabs:</strong> Reduced scrolling, but required tab-switching and disrupted flow</li>
      <li><strong>V3 ‚Äì Flat Grid with Bulk Select + Deselect:</strong> Fastest and most natural; adopted as final</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>NAICS Targeting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>V1 ‚Äì Searchable Dropdown:</strong> Users needed to know exact code</li>
      <li><strong>V2 ‚Äì Flat List:</strong> Improved access but lacked structure for scanability</li>
      <li><strong>V3 ‚Äì Accordion with Category Groupings:</strong> Best balance of overview and precision</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>High-Fidelity Designs</h2>
    <p>The final UI was clean, responsive, and designed within the company‚Äôs Material-based design system. I ensured consistent component use and alignment with internal accessibility standards. Each interaction was annotated and spec'd in Figma.</p>

    <h2>Developer Handoff</h2>
    <p>I created a detailed handoff package, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Screen-by-screen flows with edge case handling</li>
      <li>Written logic for override hierarchy and conflict resolution</li>
      <li>Interaction notes, including visual states and validations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also hosted live handoff sessions with engineers to confirm expectations and answer implementation questions in real-time.</p>

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>üìâ 40% decrease</strong> in support tickets for ranking changes</li>
      <li><strong>üöÄ 85% adoption</strong> among underwriters within the first 6 weeks</li>
      <li><strong>üïê Reduced manual effort</strong> and improved trust in the recommendation engine</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>This project taught me how to design for flexibility without compromising simplicity. By building with real mental models and user insight, we turned a rigid, backend-driven feature into a scalable decision-support tool. If given more time, I‚Äôd conduct follow-up research to track override usage trends and correlate override logic with conversion outcomes.</p>
