        <h1>Renewals: A UX Case Study</h1>
        <p>Redesigning the Carrier Recommendations Matrix for Policy-Level Comparison</p>
    </div>

        <div class="overview">

                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p>UPlace's Carrier Recommendations Matrix helps brokers identify which insurance carriers are best suited to cover a prospectâ€™s insurance needs across multiple lines. Carriers are ranked based on appetite, and the existing UI displays whether they fall within the Top 5 or Next 5 for each coverage type.</p>
                <p>However, this overview operated only at the line-of-coverage level. With most lines having several specific policy types, the existing tool failed to surface the nuances brokers needed to make informed decisions â€“ especially during renewals.</p>
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <h3>How might we empower brokers to make smarter renewal decisions by giving them the ability to compare carriers across individual policies, not just coverage types?</h3>
                <p>The original summary matrix only supported one column per line of coverage, meaning users could see carrier rankings (Top 5/Next 5) for broad categories like Property or Auto, but not for the specific policies that fall under those categories.</p>
                <p>Users needed to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compare carriers side-by-side at a policy level</li>
                    <li>Understand which carriers rank Top 5 for the specific policies they care about</li>
                    <li>Quickly assess which carriers can write the most policies across the account</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>To address this, <I></I> redesigned the matrix view to support policy-level comparisons while preserving usability and scannability.</p>

                <h5>Understanding User Needs: Research & Insights</h5>
                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <p>To better understand both user behavior and business expectations, I conducted interviews with key internal stakeholders â€” including brokers, underwriters, and business analysts who regularly use the tool
                </p>
                <p>I focused on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Decision-making behavior: How do users currently choose which carriers to prioritize?</li>

                    <li>Comparison workflows: Do users typically compare policies side-by-side? Across coverages?</li>
                        
                    <li>Usability blockers: What slows them down the most today?</li>

                </ul>
                <div class="insights-box">
                    <h2>Key Insights</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users rely heavily on carrier breadth to streamline renewals.</li>
                        <li>There was growing demand for visibility at the individual policy level, which had not existed in the tool before.</li>
                        <li>Being able to compare policies across coverages in a single view was a major priority.</li>
