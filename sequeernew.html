                <h1>Sequeer</h1>
                <p>Onboarding is the first touchpoint a user has with Sequeer, setting the tone for their journey within the
                    app. Recognizing the pivotal role it plays, I led the redesign of this experience, from researching and identifying problems to designing and handing off for implementation. The new onboarding process
                    provides an intuitive experience that guides users through the app's features and functionality.</p>

                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>Sequeer is a B2C mobile app serving as a global search engine for the LGBTQ community. It provides a safe, inclusive space for connection, discovery, and engagement with LGBTQ-friendly resources, events, and services.</p>
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Sequeer's onboarding process was confusing due to a lack of clear guidance, visual cues, and limited
                    interactivity. Additionally, the app relied solely on phone number signup, lacking a traditional login
                    feature. These issues made it difficult for users to understand the app and impacted its ability to
                    onboard
                    and retain users effectively.</p>

                </div>
                <h2>Final Solution</h2>
                <p>The new designs introduce a traditional login feature with a twist, offering flexible login opportunities. The revamped onboarding process is more intuitive and user-friendly, incorporating trackers and buttons for a smoother experience.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>We conducted a comprehensive analysis to identify areas requiring improvement. Our evaluation revealed several key issues:</p>

                    <div class="box" data-number="1">
                        <p><strong>System Status Visibility:</strong> Lack of status indicators could lead to user confusion regarding their progress through the onboarding flow.</p>

                    <div class="box" data-number="2">
                        <p><strong>User Control and Freedom:</strong> Certain steps could not be skipped and the appearance of 'next' buttons was delayed, which could impact users' ability to navigate the onboarding flow smoothly.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box" data-number="3">
                        <p><strong>Consistency and Standards:</strong>: The inconsistencies in the design of call-to-action (CTA) buttons included differences in size, color, and placement, which could potentially confuse users and detract from the overall experience.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box" data-number="4">
                        <p><strong>Help and Documentation:</strong> Instructions provided during onboarding were unclear, and the images shown were confusing due to a lack of explanations and previews of the app's features.</p>

                        create a more user-friendly and efficient onboarding process that encourages users to explore and

                            log in, such as using email, social media accounts, or phone numbers, to cater to different

                    <strong>My solution: introduce key features of the app during onboarding and incorporate progress trackers, next
