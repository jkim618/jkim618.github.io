                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>The tool is designed to calculate insurance premiums for different vehicle categories, known as power units, and is tailored for insurance producers. However, the current tool presents several user experience challenges:
                    </p>
                    <p>1. <b>Disconnected Inputs</b>: Users struggled to see how their inputs affected the table data, causing confusion and disrupting workflow.</p>
                    <p>2. <b>Low Input Visibility</b>: The input fields were unclear, making it difficult for users to understand how their entries influenced the premium estimates.</p>
                    <p>3. <b>Cluttered Layout</b>: The table required excessive horizontal scrolling, leading to information overload and making it hard for users to efficiently view and interpret the data.
                    </p>
                    <div class="imgContainer">

                <div class="solution-container">
                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>To resolve these usability issues, I redesigned the tool with a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. The calculator was made interactive, providing real-time feedback as users adjusted inputs, allowing them to clearly understand how premiums were calculated. I also introduced specialized calculators for each vehicle category, reducing cognitive load and improving data interpretation.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, I restructured the workflow to be vehicle-centric. Instead of the initial, counterintuitive process of adding locations first, users now begin by adding vehicle groups, followed by mapping them to locations. This logical progression simplified navigation and made the tool more aligned with user expectations.</p>

                    <h2>Initial Ideas</h2>
                    <p>To engage stakeholders, I developed two low-fidelity iterations addressing key usability issues. Both versions prioritized interactivity, allowing users to break down each factor and view details by zip code or location. This enhancement clarified how different inputs influenced calculations, improving user comprehension of location-specific impacts.</p>

                    <p>I also restructured the table to be vehicle-centric, enabling users to add vehicles first before mapping them to locations. This change aligned with the tool’s focus on auto premiums and corrected the previous design’s flawed logic.</p>

                    <p>I presented the initial ideas and low-fidelity wireframes to the stakeholders, who responded positively, particularly valuing the detailed breakdown of the calculator. They did, however, provide additional requirements that necessitated further refinement of the design.</p>
                    <p>Key new requirements included integrating global inputs and creating context-specific calculations for individual vehicle groups. I returned to the drawing board to incorporate their feedback and enhance the design accordingly.</p>

This flow captures all essential elements and guides the implementation of the new features. To finalize it, I facilitated a workshop with stakeholders, allowing us to collaboratively review and refine the user flow.

                    <h2>Improving Data Navigation</h2>
                    <p>The initial design relied solely on dropdowns for data selection, which was confusing and lacked a clear hierarchy. To address these limitations, I implemented a dual approach: a top-level filter using dropdowns and the introduction of navigation tabs.</p>

                        <div class="nav-item">

                          <h3>Before</h3>
                          <p>The previous design was characterized by an overloaded layout that made it difficult for users to navigate and understand the relationships between different sections. The vertical and subvertical dropdowns were stacked directly on top of each other, creating confusion and potential usability issues. Furthermore, the "Top Loss Drivers" and "Solution Matrix & Library" dropdowns were automatically linked, which could be unexpected and frustrating for users. </p>

                        <div class="nav-item">

                          <h3>After</h3>
                          <p>The redesigned interface features a dedicated header section where users can select the vertical (industry) and subvertical. These choices determine the five lines of coverage tabs displayed, which then act as a global navigation system controlling the content shown below. The clear separation of the header section and the main content area improves visual clarity and makes it easier for users to navigate between different sections of the platform.</p>

                    <h2>Reducing Cognitive Overload</h2>
                    <p>I separated the ‘Loss Impact’ and ‘Solution Matrix’ sections into distinct pages. Dedicated buttons now allow users to easily switch between these sections. This decision was based on stakeholder feedback, recognizing that for many users, the ‘Loss Impact’ graph serves primarily as an introductory visual, while the ‘Solution Matrix’ is the primary focus. Additionally, expanding the ‘Solution Matrix’ table required more real estate, making it more suitable for a dedicated page. This reorganization not only improved platform performance by reducing the amount of content loaded at once but also enhanced future scalability, ensuring the 'Solution Matrix' can effectively accommodate growth in complexity.</p>

                          <p>Clicking on "View solution matrix" would scroll the user to the bottom of the page to access the solution matrix table. </p>

                          <p>Clicking on "View solution matrix" now navigates the user to a dedicated section featuring the solution matrix and the table. Users can easily return to the previous page by clicking the "Back to Loss Impact" button located in the top left corner.</p>
