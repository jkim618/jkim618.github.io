                    <p>Following a stakeholder session, I quickly created a preliminary wireframe to initiate discussions. This rough draft effectively communicated my ideas and highlighted potential advantages and drawbacks. In a subsequent workshop, stakeholders confirmed that the vendor preview was unnecessary and expressed a preference for a more prominent solution matrix. They appreciated the comprehensive list of loss drivers, as it allowed them to easily compare all solutions at once.</p>

                    <h2>Improving Data Navigation</h2>
                    <p>The initial design relied solely on dropdowns for data selection, which was confusing and lacked a clear hierarchy. To address these limitations, I implemented a dual approach: a top-level filter using dropdowns and the introduction of navigation tabs.</p>

                          <h3>Before</h3>
                          <p>The previous design was characterized by an overloaded layout that made it difficult for users to navigate and understand the relationships between different sections. The vertical and subvertical dropdowns were stacked directly on top of each other, creating confusion and potential usability issues. Furthermore, the "Top Loss Drivers" and "Solution Matrix & Library" dropdowns were automatically linked, which could be unexpected and frustrating for users. </p>

                          <h3>After</h3>
                          <p>The redesigned interface features a dedicated header section where users can select the vertical (industry) and subvertical. These choices determine the five lines of coverage tabs displayed, which then act as a global navigation system controlling the content shown below. The clear separation of the header section and the main content area improves visual clarity and makes it easier for users to navigate between different sections of the platform.</p>

                    <h2>Reducing Cognitive Overload</h2>
                    <p>I separated the ‘Loss Impact’ and ‘Solution Matrix’ sections into distinct pages. Dedicated buttons now allow users to easily switch between these sections. This decision was based on stakeholder feedback, recognizing that for many users, the ‘Loss Impact’ graph serves primarily as an introductory visual, while the ‘Solution Matrix’ is the primary focus. Additionally, expanding the ‘Solution Matrix’ table required more real estate, making it more suitable for a dedicated page. This reorganization not only improved platform performance by reducing the amount of content loaded at once but also enhanced future scalability, ensuring the 'Solution Matrix' can effectively accommodate growth in complexity.</p>

                          <p>Clicking on "View solution matrix" now navigates the user to a dedicated section featuring the solution matrix and the table. Users can easily return to the previous page by clicking the "Back to Loss Impact" button located in the top left corner.</p>
