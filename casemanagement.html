                <h1>Appian Case Management</h1>
                <p>I led the design of citizen portal landing page for Appian Constituent Case Management to enhance the user experience for citizens as well as creating the case creation process.</p>

                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>Constituent Case Management involves handling cases related to citizens at the state and local government level. It includes the intake, processing, and recording of activities for cases, which can range from investigations to approvals. This workflow allows users to submit cases on behalf of citizens or for citizens to submit cases themselves.</p>
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Feedback from stakeholders and partners highlighted a key challenge: the current citizen-facing experience lacks clear guidance. Upon navigating to the agency's welcome page, citizens may not immediately recognize the need to 'create a case' and what that exactly entails. This lack of clarity results in users not having enough context to take appropriate actions. </p>

                </div>
                <h2>Final Solution</h2>
                <p>The redesign aims to provide a more guided user experience with clearer context. It includes suggested case types with explanations, a search feature for quick case identification, helpful documentation and resources, and the ability for users to create an account and register.</p>

                <p>I developed a user flow illustrating how citizens can navigate the new portal to create and submit a case.</p>

                <p>
                    In the initial stages of the redesign, low-fidelity wireframes were created to visualize the layout and structure of the new portal.</p>

                        <p><strong>Enhance Navigation:</strong> Improve the platform's navigation to allow users to move

                <p>I iterated on the dashboard's solution matrix to enhance the user experience.
                    The current design features color-coded keys that improve
                    information organization and efficiency. By optimizing text density in the table and its preview,
                    the design makes effective use of UI real estate, ensuring a clean and concise presentation of data.

                                Testing with users, while not conducted for this project, could have provided valuable

                                Specifically, user testing could have helped validate the redesign decisions, such as
                                the introduction of a clear information hierarchy and intuitive navigation.</p>
