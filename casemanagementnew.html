                        <p>Constituent Case Management involves handling cases related to citizens at the state and local government level. It includes the intake, processing, and recording of activities for cases, which can range from investigations to approvals. This workflow allows users to submit cases on behalf of citizens or for citizens to submit cases themselves.</p>
                        <p>I led the design of citizen portal landing page for Appian Constituent Case Management to enhance the user experience for citizens as well as creating the case creation process.</p>

                    <div class="text-section">
                        <p>Feedback from stakeholders and partners highlighted a key challenge: the current citizen-facing experience lacks clear guidance. Upon navigating to the agency's welcome page, citizens may not immediately recognize the need to 'create a case' and what that exactly entails. This lack of clarity results in users not having enough context to take appropriate actions.</p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>The redesign aims to provide a more guided user experience with clearer context. It includes suggested case types with explanations, a search feature for quick case identification, helpful documentation and resources, and the ability for users to create an account and register.</p>

                <p>Our team conducted stakeholder meetings to gather crucial insights, shaping the redesign process to align with business objectives and user needs effectively. </p>

                <h2>Design Goals</h2>
                <p>Based on the user needs and stakeholder requirements, I summarized the higher level goals I hope to achieve with the redesign.</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. <strong>Enhance navigation: </strong> Improve the platform's navigation to allow users to move between sections seamlessly and access features efficiently.</p>
                    <p>2. <strong>Clarify Information Hierarchy: </strong> Establish a clear and logical arrangement of
                        content to help users easily find and understand relevant information.</p>
                    <p>3. <strong>Create a Cohesive User Flow: </strong> Develop a consistent and intuitive flow
                        throughout the dashboard to guide users through their tasks and interactions smoothly.</p>
                    <p>4. <strong>Facilitate Data Exploration: </strong> Enable users to explore and analyze data
                        effectively by providing robust filtering options, allowing them to refine their view and
                        focus on specific information relevant to their needs.</p>

                </ul>

                <h2>Initial Wireframes</h2>
                <div class="two-column">
                    <div class="text-section">
                        <p>Following a session with stakeholders, I quickly created a preliminary wireframe to initiate discussions. Although it was a rough draft, it effectively communicated my ideas and highlighted the potential advantages and drawbacks.</p>
                        <p>Pros:</p>
                        <ul class="pros">
                            <p>1. <span class="highlight">Improved information hierarchy</span> with a top-down approach.</p>
                            <p>2. Ability to <span class="highlight">filter information</span> based on loss drivers.</p>
                            <p>3. <span class="highlight">Combined view</span> of the solution matrix graph and table, providing comprehensive data in one glance.</p>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Cons:</p>
                        <ul class="cons">
                            <p>1. Potential <span class="highlight">confusion from using two dropdowns</span> for vertical and subvertical.</p>
                            <p>2. The solution matrix graph appears <span class="highlight">small and cramped</span>.</p>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Key takeaways were to make the vertical and subvertical elements more prominent, enlarge the solution matrix graph, and defer vendor information display.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-section">
                        <img src="path/images/uglywireframe.png" alt="Problem Image">
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Solution Matrix Iteration</h2>
                <p>After receiving feedback from stakeholders, I created improved wireframes. I enlarged the solution matrix and replaced the vendor preview with a 'Compare Top Vendors' text link, using the freed space for solution information preview. However, both iterations had issues with the lengthy loss drivers column, even when using an expand-collapse format. To address this, I iterated again, turning the loss drivers into <span class="highlight">colored keys</span>.</p>

                <div class="imgContainer">
                    <img src="path/images/iterations.png">
                </div>
                <h2>Design Decision 1: Dropdowns and Navigation Tabs for Data Selection</h2>
                <p>To address the limitations of relying solely on dropdowns for data selection, we implemented a dual
                    approach. This includes a top-level filter using <span class="highlight">dropdowns</span> and the introduction of <span class="highlight">navigation tabs</span>.
                    This enhancement provides users with more intuitive ways to filter and navigate through different
                    datasets, improving overall usability and user experience. </p>
                <div class="imgContainer">
                    <img src="path/images/tabs.png">
                </div>
                <h2>Design Decision 2: Reorganizing Dashboard Sections for Improved Usability</h2>
                <p>I separated the
                    "Loss Impact" and "Solution Matrix" sections into <span class="highlight">distinct pages</span> in my later iteration, enhancing
                    user experience by
                    reducing cognitive overload. Users can now effortlessly switch between sections using dedicated
                    buttons, promoting a more intuitive and streamlined experience. This reorganization not only
                    improved platform performance by reducing the amount of content loaded at once but also enhanced
                    content organization.

                <h2>Design Decision 3: Use of Filter Chips</h2>
                <p>To provide users with more control over the displayed data, we implemented <span class="highlight">filter chips</span>. These filter
                    chips allow users to refine the displayed graph and table by selecting specific loss drivers.</p>

                                Specifically, user testing could have helped validate the redesign decisions, such as
                                the introduction of a clear information hierarchy and intuitive navigation.</p>
